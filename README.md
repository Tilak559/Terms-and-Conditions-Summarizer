# Terms and Conditions Summarizer

The project aims to build a Terms & Conditions (T&C) summarizer using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The T&C of various websites and applications are often lengthy and complex, making it challenging for users to read and understand them fully. The proposed solution will use NLP techniques to extract the most relevant information from the T&C and provide a concise summary for the user to understand. The project will involve various steps, including data collection, pre-processing, feature extraction, and summarization. The summarizer will be trained on a large dataset of T&Cs, and the output will be evaluated against human generated summaries for accuracy and relevance. The end result will be a tool that simplifies the T&C reading process, providing users with an understandable summary of their rights and obligations when using online services.
